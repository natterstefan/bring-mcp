# MCP Server for Bring! Shopping

![bring-mcp](./assets/header.jpg)

This project implements a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in TypeScript that exposes the functionalities of the Bring! shopping list API. It enables applications like Claude Desktop to interact with your Bring! shopping lists using standardized MCP tools.

The server integrates the `bring-shopping` npm package for Bring! API access and leverages `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to provide an MCP-compliant server interface.

> This could cause the MCP server to stop functioning without prior notice.

## 🧩 Recommended Claude Desktop Configuration

To use this server in Claude Desktop via `npx`, insert the following into your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bring-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "bring-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "MAIL": "your_bring_email@example.com",
        "PW": "YOUR_BRING_PASSWORD_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is the recommended and most portable configuration. It ensures you always use the latest version published to npm without needing local installation.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repo (or obtain the files)**

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd path/to/bring-mcp
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create `.env` file (if not injecting ENV directly):**

   ```env
   MAIL=your_email@example.com
   PW=your_password
   ```

5. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Make script executable (optional on Unix):**

   ```bash
   chmod +x build/src/index.js
   ```

## 🏃 Running the Server

Launch the MCP server with:

```bash
node build/src/index.js
```

If successful, you'll see: `MCP server for Bring! API is running on STDIO` (on `stderr`).

---

## 🧪 Testing with MCP Inspector

1. Ensure `npm run build` has been executed.
2. Ensure `.env` with valid credentials exists.
3. Run Inspector:

   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node /ABS/PATH/bring-mcp/build/src/index.js
   ```

      "env": {
        "MAIL": "your_bring_email@example.com",
        "PW": "YOUR_BRING_PASSWORD_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
